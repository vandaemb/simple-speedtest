simple-speedtest
================

A simple speedtest, based on the work of Brandon Checketts [speedtest][1].
The purpose of this speedtest is to check the quality of mobile data connections within an intranet environment. 
It logs down/up speeds as well as the gps location of the tester whenever the test is initiated.
